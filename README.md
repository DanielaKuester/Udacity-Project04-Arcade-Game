# Arcade Game Project - A _Frogger_ Clone

## Instructions: How to Play

The Arcade Game clone is a little game that is modelled after the well-known
game _Frogger_. You can steer the player with the arrow keys. The goal of the
game is to reach the water line.

But watch out! Don't let the bugs get you! When you collide with a bug, you have
to start again.

## Play Online in the Live View

You can play the game here: https://danielakuester.github.io/Udacity-Project04-Arcade-Game/

## Installation

Feel free to download the Memory Game to your PC.
1. Download the resository as a zip-file, extract it and open the index.html to run the Memory Game.
2. Clone the repository with Git Bash: ```$ git clone https://github.com/DanielaKuester/Udacity-Project04-Arcade-Game```

## Credits

These resources helped me to get a better understanding of the arcade game project:

* The [Arcade Game Study Jam by Edoh Kodjo](https://youtu.be/mgFWZGpj3IE?t=1). I will probably use his explanations to refactor my code after the submission of my project.
The aim: to build an ES6-version of the game.
* The [Arcade Game Study Jam by Antonella Dean](https://youtu.be/Gj3Ecyw4F-A?t=1) helped me to make the canvas show, to get a basic understanding of the game so that I could create the player
and the enemies.


## External Code Used in this Project

* The starter code for this project comes from the following [Udacity Arcade Game repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) by Richard Kalehoff. I downloaded it directly as a ZIP-file from my Udacity classroom instead of forking or cloning it. That is why you don't see a connection between the starter code and mine.
* The collision function and the switch to move the player were taken from [Antonella Dean's Arcade Game project](https://github.com/aberdean/google-scholarship-fend-projects/tree/master/classic-arcade-game-clone). I simplified the collision function and the switch to fit to the purpose of my arcade game.
* The fonts are the "Shrikhand" and "Shadows Into Light" fonts taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Shadows+Into+Light|Shrikhand).
* The code for the modal box was taken from [this tutorial](https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-create-modal-popup-box) and afterwards adapted to the needs of my Arcade Game project.

## Future Updates

I am planning to update and upgrade the game after my Nanodegree graduation.
I want to implement the following functions:
* A new version that is updated to use ES6 code, based on the [Arcade Game Study Jam by Edoh Kodjo](https://youtu.be/mgFWZGpj3IE?t=1)
* Choosing between different player figures
* Gems and other collectibles
* A score board that displays the score, a timer, collected points/gems and life points/hearts
* A key that has to be collected to win the game
* Obstacles like in the original _Frogger_ game
* A bigger canvas that comes nearer to the original _Frogger_
* Several difficulty levels

## Contributing

This repository is one of my projects as a Udacity student. I am planning to update the project later to document my learning progress and my growing
programming skills. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
